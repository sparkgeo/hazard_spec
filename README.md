# Hazard Specification

## About

The Hazard specification project is a suite of specifications that aim to standardise how hazard indicator data are queried and structured. The project aligns hazard indicators from the open-source community, government, and academics to provide a unified understanding of hazard identification standardisation.

**The aim is to accelerate the adoption of standard physical risk metrics.**

The Hazard Catalog specification is a foundational aspect of collaboration and data interoperability, supporting the OS-C mission and objectives and the EODH project.

A description of a Hazard can be found [here](https://github.com/os-climate/hazard/blob/main/HAZARD.md).

This repository contains the core specification, including the data schema.

See the changelog for continuous updates

## Features

The specification in this repo contains three parts:

- [Core Specification](core/README.md)
- Geojson Encoding
- Hazard Indicators

To integrate 3rd party indicators, we provide extensions to the indicator schema and specification.
